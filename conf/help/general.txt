HELP FOR SIMPLEIRC v1.0

SimpleIRC is a very simple IRC server supporting only a subset of the huge list of IRC commands.  It is based on the Perl module POE::Component::Server::IRC, and is open sourced under the MIT license.  More information can be found online at http://effectsoftware.com/simpleirc/

SimpleIRC has a built-in NickServ bot for managing nicks, and a built-in ChanServ for managing channels.  For further details, please send a "help" private message to either bot.  The server supports many standard IRC commands, with a few extras:
